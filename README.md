# Debate-Silent-Round-Result-Finder
A program that can guess the results of silent rounds in debate competitions (in both WSDC/AP and BP formats), when given the link of the tabs (calicotab.com).

# Note
1) This only works for tournaments who are tabulated with Calicotab/Tabbycat.
2) This code may not work for people in the top or bottom of the standings before the silent round. (if so then why are you even asking, let me tell you- if you are at the top of standings, then you would break, if you are at the bottom, then you wouldn't break.)

# Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
